🚗 Predicta – AI Car Intelligence & Vehicle Health Prediction System

Predicta is an AI-powered vehicle intelligence system designed to predict potential car issues and assess overall vehicle health using machine learning. The project focuses on predictive maintenance, helping identify mechanical problems at an early stage to reduce breakdown risks and improve vehicle safety.

The system analyzes user-reported symptoms and vehicle-related parameters, performs data preprocessing and feature engineering, and applies supervised machine learning models to classify problem severity and predict possible faults. By converting raw inputs into meaningful insights, Predicta supports data-driven maintenance decisions.

An interactive Streamlit web application is integrated into the project, enabling users to input vehicle information and receive real-time predictions and maintenance recommendations through a clean and user-friendly interface. The project represents a complete end-to-end ML pipeline, including data handling, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Predicta demonstrates practical application of machine learning in real-world automotive scenarios and is relevant for use cases such as vehicle diagnostics, fleet monitoring, and intelligent transportation systems.
